# Summary

`Summary.tsx` condenses the expense data returned by the analyzer: it aggregates total spend, builds per-category totals using the shared category list, and renders each category with its share of overall expenses.

Income transactions are intentionally ignored so the overview focuses purely on outflows, mirroring how the AI categorization step operates.
